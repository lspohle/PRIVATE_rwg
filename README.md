> “Honor your inner child by losing yourself in simple pleasures.” - Kim del Valle Walker

We, a friend of mine and I, needed twenty randomly generated words. Instead of simply searching for a generator on the internet, we
decided to play around a little and code one ourselves. 

## Our generator 
The program randomly generates a specific amount of words. The user may ask the generator for up to 2000 words. It will print the requested amount of words as long as the user's input is valid.

## Our generator and your benefit
1. `Git clone` the current repository.
      
        git clone https://github.com/lspohle/random_words_generator.git
2. `Compile` it by using a compiler of your choice.
      
        gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra *.c
3. `Execute` the executable file and add your `requested_amount` of words. `a.out` is the default executable name generated by `gcc`. 

        ./a.out requested_amount
4. You may add words to the text file `library.txt` in order to expand the amount of potential words.
